                    <h2>Info</h2>
                    <p>Kai Park has always been an outcast and he's used to that. His intense obsession with the paranormal has led to his ostracization from others. It doesn't help that, one day, he mysteriously develop the ability to see ghosts and any attempt to explain that to people just made him be labelled as the weirdo. As a result of his turbulent childhood, he opts to be reserved and withdrawn. He can be really awkward with people as he often deeply absorbed in thought. But, he can be relied upon when investigating the mysteries of the town.</p>

                    <p>Kai was born in Meliora with his parents and grandmother. However, when he was 7, he had to move after his parents had a falling out with his grandmother. Forced to say goodbye to his best friend, he was all alone.</p>
                    <p>He struggled to make friends due to his interest in the paranormal and ghosts. Even his parents had trouble connecting with him, but his mom would still to put in effort. His father, on the other hand, grew tired of him and they became distant. Kai felt he barely had anyone to go to as he got older. Constant conflicts and unease at home, school, and himself.</p>
                    <p>When Kai was 14, he suddenly developed the ability to see ghosts. Unable to differentiate between living and dead, this led to incidents that made peers bully him. Later on, Kai came out as trans and the bullying got worse, with his own father mocking him. Kai would find some relief when his parents divorced but his mom decided to move back to Meliora. Back in his old childhood home left behind by his recently deceased grandmother, Kai gets a fresh start but is hesitant to open up to people again. But one thing he deeply wishes to do is reunite with his old friend. Maybe she hasn't forgotten him. But will she even recognize him? Or even accept him?</p>
